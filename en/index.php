                    The company I work for is located in Quebec and Gatineau. We had a project for the improvement of our shipping facilities in Gatineau and after a short research on the internet, I found LM Manutentions. A quick email and shortly after I had a call back and a week later, we had the chance to visit a client of LM Manutentions for a visit in order to see how the facilities that we were interested in are working. Since then, we have conducted two projects with LM Manutentions. We had an excellent technical expertise, quotes, delivery, installation and after sales follow-up services.                  </p>

                    LM Manutentions = High Expertise, Prompt Service, Competitive Prices
                    After having been mandated by my client for the manufacturing of a new conveyor, I relied on the expertise of LM Manutentions.
                    LM Manutentions took charge of the project, and after a few direct discussions with the client, the submission has been accepted and was consistent in all respects with the requirements of the client. Then, the client gave us the order, because everything was clear, precise, and delivered according to the customer's need and also met their budgets.
                    Many thanks for your collaboration!

                    I had the chance to work with LM Manutentions repeatedly. Whether during the preparation of budgetary prices or call for tenders, after the contract-awarding processes or during commissioning, Caroline and her team have always been available, ready to listen and were able to provide high quality work within timelines and budgets. The experience that LM Manutentions acquired over the years has been invaluable during our discussions, especially when it comes to finding quick and effective solutions to optimize existing systems. I will count on LM Manutentions without hesitation when the opportunity arises again!
